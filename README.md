# Open Source Arras (APS++)

**Open Source Arras is beta software.** This build is **not** representative of the final product. Expect bugs and missing features.

## Requirements

In order to run your server via localhost, you will need to install these first:
- [The latest release of the template](https://github.com/Taureon/aps-plus-plus/releases)
- [Node.js v16 or later](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws)

Once `Node.js` and `ws` are installed, open either `run.bat` (if you're on Windows) or `run.sh` (if you're not). If there aren't any errors, your server will start up. Go to `localhost:26301` in your favourite web browser (keep the terminal window open, closing it will shut down the server) to play.

If you want to stay up to date, fork this template, download a git client, and sync the fork whenever there's a major update.
